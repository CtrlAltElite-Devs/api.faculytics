# Architectural Decisions

This document tracks key architectural decisions and patterns used in the `api.faculytics` project.

## 1. External ID Stability

Moodle's `moodleCategoryId` and `moodleCourseId` are used as business keys for idempotent upserts to ensure primary key stability in the local database. This prevents local UUIDs from changing during synchronization.

## 2. Unit of Work Pattern

Leveraging MikroORM's `EntityManager` to ensure transactional integrity during complex synchronization processes. This ensures that either a full sync operation succeeds or none of it is committed.

## 3. Base Job Pattern

All background jobs extend `BaseJob` to provide consistent logging, startup execution logic, and error handling. This standardization simplifies monitoring and debugging of scheduled tasks.

## 4. Questionnaire Leaf-Weight Rule

To ensure scoring mathematical integrity:

- Only "leaf" sections (those without sub-sections) can have weights and questions.
- The sum of all leaf section weights within a questionnaire version must equal exactly 100.
- This is enforced recursively by the `QuestionnaireSchemaValidator`.

## 5. Institutional Snapshotting

Submissions store a literal snapshot of institutional data (Campus Name, Department Code, etc.) at the moment of submission. This decouples historical feedback from future changes in the institutional hierarchy (e.g., renaming a department).

## 6. Multi-Column Unique Constraints

For data integrity in questionnaires, unique constraints are applied across multiple columns (e.g., `respondentId`, `facultyId`, `versionId`, `semesterId`, `courseId`) using MikroORM's `@Unique` class decorator to prevent duplicate submissions.
